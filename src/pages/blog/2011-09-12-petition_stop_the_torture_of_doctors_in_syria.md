_**The Syrian physician Sakher Hallak lived well in Syria. But when he signed a petition calling for doctors to treat gunshot protesters, his destiny changed. He was selected to die and to frighten other doctors.**_

Following the death of Sakher Hallak, who was tortured to death by the Syrian regime because he signed a petition, urging that doctors should treat gunshot protestors - I today start a petition against the Syrian regime.

The Syrian regime must immediately stop the torture and violence against the Syrian people.

**Doctors all over the world must have the right to treat all people and do what they are trained to do: save lives. Whether it's a politician or an ordinary citizen who has been gunshot when protesting against the dictatorial regime.**

[PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION, AND SPREAD THE WORD!](https://www.change.org/petitions/stop-the-torture-of-doctors-in-syria)
